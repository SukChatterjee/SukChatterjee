## 👋 Hi, I’m Sukanya

I’m an Information Systems graduate student focused on building structured, data-driven solutions that solve real business problems.

My foundation was shaped in enterprise environments, working with SAP systems and large-scale data processes. That experience taught me to think beyond isolated features to understand workflows, dependencies, data integrity, and how decisions scale across organizations.

Today, my work spans:

📊 Analytics dashboards that translate raw data into executive-level insights  
🤖 AI-powered agents designed to support intelligent decision-making  
⚙️ Workflow automation systems that reduce friction and improve efficiency  
🏗️ Structured system design that connects business needs with technical execution  

Across domains retail analytics, climate dashboards, automation pipelines, AI agents, and hackathon builds what remains constant is systems thinking. I enjoy transforming ambiguity into structured logic and measurable outcomes.

I bridge business analytics and product strategy through structured systems and intelligent automation that drive measurable impact.

🎯 Currently exploring opportunities in Product, Business Analytics, and AI-driven technology roles.

⚡ Fun fact: I can map a complex business process in minutes, but deciding what to order for dinner takes forever.
